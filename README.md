# First Git Experience: FIZZ BUZZ!


## Coding Instructions
The "Fizz-Buzz test" is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can't seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag. The text of the programming assignment is as follows:


Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 

For multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number.

For the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 

For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.



## Homework:

1. Learn the basics of Git commands<br>

	Here is one [overview] (http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)<br>

	Here is a fun video using Tinker Toys called [Git for Ages 4 and up](https://youtu.be/1ffBJ4sVUb4)<br>

2. Terminal time and Git<br>

	copy the url of this repo from the git site. <br>

	The url is in the image below:
![](./images/GitFizzBuzzURL.png?raw=true)

<p>On your terminal try to type the following (remember to paste the link you just copied):
		
		git clone https://github.com/Irafam/01-FizzBuzz.git


	Now that you have cloned the repo into your directory, you can work on your FizzBuzz assignment

3. When you have any changes, you should 
	
	ADD 
		git add *

	and

	COMMIT
		git commit -m 'some relevant message'

	and 

	PUSH
