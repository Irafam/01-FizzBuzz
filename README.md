# First Git Experience: FIZZ BUZZ!


## Instructions
The "Fizz-Buzz test" is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can't seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag. The text of the programming assignment is as follows:


Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 

For multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number.

For the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 

For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
